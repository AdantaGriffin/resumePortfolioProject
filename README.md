## Project Goals
Portfolio Website
For this project, you will build a personal portfolio site, a static website where you can share the projects that you build in this Path. Typically, a portfolio website will have a main page that features different projects that you’ve built and another page that contains contact information, in case someone wants to reach out to you. Occasionally, there are additional pages for each project, detailing the technology used.

## Project Objectives
* Build a website using HTML, CSS
* Add at least one interactive feature using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use the command line and file navigation
* Develop locally on your computer
* Deploy your site to the web using GitHub Pages
* OPTIONAL: Buy a custom domain name and have it point to your GitHub Pages website

## Prerequisites:
HTML/CSS
JavaScript
Git and GitHub
Command line and file navigation

## Requirements
* Text Editor (VSCode)
* Git Version Control
* GitHub 

## To Do
>1. Plan your project
>2. Visualize your end result. What is it built with? What can it do? Make sure that it satisfies all of the project objectives.
>3. Make a timeline for yourself and avoid the temptation to build things that aren’t required. Setting firm boundaries and deadlines will keep you on track and prevent scope creep.

*The following tasks will help you identify natural break points.*
---
>4. Wireframe your website: Using pencil and paper, or a wireframing software of your choice, draft what you’d like your portfolio to look like.

>5. Create files and deploy it locally: On your computer, create a directory to hold your files and create each file. Deploy your code locally to see what it looks like in the browser.

*Version control*
---
>6. Set up Git tracking in your directory and make sure to add and commit changes as you make them.

>7. Build the Home Page: The home page will be the main page that users visit. It should prominently feature your name, along with a selection of several projects that you are most proud of. Each project should have a picture, a summary of the project, and the technology used to build it.

>8. Build the Contact Page: The contact page includes your email address, as well as any other relevant information such as your LinkedIn profile or a personal photo.

>9. Style the content: Now that you have your content, consider how you would like it to look. Do you want to arrange your projects in a grid? In an asymmetrical arrangement? What colors do you want to use to personalize the page?

>10. Make it interactive: Use JavaScript to add interactivity to your website.

>11. Make it responsive: Use responsive design to ensure that your page is viewable on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

>12. Publish to the web: Take what you’ve built and use GitHub pages to share with the world.

*Next Steps*

**Congratulations on building your own portfolio! You’re welcome to expand your portfolio beyond these two pages. For example, you can include a page for each project that you’ve built.**

## Challenges and Credits
This project is a challenge from the Full Stack Developer course on Codeacademy's website to practice by what I learned to create websites utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
